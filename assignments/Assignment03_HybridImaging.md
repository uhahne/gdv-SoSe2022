# Assignment #3 - Hybrid imaging

## Task
Implement a hybrid imaging application using Python and OpenCV. The application should load two images and create one hybrid image from those two. Check the [original sources](http://olivalab.mit.edu/hybridimage.htm) about the topic.
Note that you might need to transform one image so that it fits optimally to the other image. You can use the transformation operations from GDV Tutorials 11-13.
Submit at least two resulting hybrid images that illustrate the effect in a nice way.
Write a short readme how to run the code and a brief explanation (max. 200 words, German or English).

## Rating
- Low frequency image is correctly created (1 point)
- High frequency image is correctly created (2 points)
- Hybrid image is correctly combined (1 point)
- Image transformation so that images fit is properly implemented either
  - with a suitable user interface for manual transformation (up to 3 points)
  - with an automatic process that transforms (a group of) images to fit (up to 3 points)
    - example groups are: animals fromt the side, faces, portraits,...
- Nice (self-made) hybrid images are submitted (up to 2 points)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented (up to 2 points)
- Readme is well written and contains all steps to install and run the code (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py file) and readme.md file as one zip file via FELIX.
- Script runs without changes. One output image is generated.
- In the source code, it is clearly visible that the hybrid image is computed.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
